# Guacamole game 

This is an interpretation of the famous Whack-a-mole game. Players are invited to smash avocadoes that appear
on the screen and earn as many points as they possibly can under 60 seconds. This game helps to boost player's concentration 
as different avocados give different points. The best score of the player is stored and shown during the game. 
This is a HTML game and it should run on any browser.

## UX
### Project Goals
The primary goal of this project is to create a simple interactive game that will run in any browser.

### User's Goals
The main audience of this game will be kids and young adults who like to play games or want a quick distraction.
The game promotes quick decision making and concentration so it also can be used by older people.

Player's goals are:
* to play a fun game;
* to see the best score and try to beat it;
* to be able to change the complexity of the game;
* to be able to turn on and off music.

### User Stories
As a first time player, I want:
* to understand the rules or be able to find them;
* to be able to navigate the game easily;
* to be able to turn the music off if necessary.

As a return player, I want:
* to see my previous score;
* to be able to increase the complexity of the game.

### Wireframes
After thorough consideration of users' and developer's goals, the following [wireframes](assets/wireframes) were created. 

### Developer's Goals
This is a learning project and the main purpose of it's creating is to learn JavaScript 
and interactive design implementation. Another very improtant goal is to build a game 
that will be added to the portfolio. 

### Design Choices
The overall feel of the game is simple and relaxed. Even though the game itself is intense,
the following design choices were made to implement the relaxed feeling:

#### Fonts

#### Icons
All icons were chosen for their obvious meaning so that they can be easily understood by everyone.

#### Media
Images shouldn't be overwhelming or disctucting.

### Testing Using Validators
The website was continuously tested on emulated large and small screens when writing the code. 
Upon completion of the writing process, developer used W3C Css Validation Service and W3C MarkUp Validation Service to check the validity of the code. 

### Automated Testing

### Client Stories Testing

### Testing client stories from UX section in README.md

### Testing on Different Browsers and Devices
The website was tested on different browsers and proved to be issue-free on the following browsers:
